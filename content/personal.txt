h3. Career

I am currently working on my Ph.D in the "EECS":http://eecs.berkeley.edu/ department at the "University of California, Berkeley":http://www.berkeley.edu/. I received my BS degree at the "University of California, Santa Barbara":http://www.ucsb.edu/ in the "Computer Engineering":http://www.ce.ucsb.edu/ department. During that time, I did several internships. In 2005, I interned at an IT company, "Novacoast":http://www.novacoast.com/index.php. I worked on the back end inventory web system where I first started using "php":http://www.php.net/ with "postgreSQL":http://www.postgresql.org/. That same year, I also started doing undergraduate research with professor "Ryan Kastner":http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kastner/ (now at the University of California, San Diego). I worked on the "Adaptive Radiolocation":http://express.ece.ucsb.edu/radiolocation/ project. The goal of the project was to use ISM-band radios (e.g. 802.11b) for GPS-less cooperative radiolocation using time-of-arrival. My participation in the project was the implementation of algorithms on FPGAs. During the summer of 2006, I interned at "Microsoft":http://www.microsoft.com/ in the windows vista deployment group. This group handled the installation step of vista and deployment of vista over the network to multiple machines. In particular, I worked with the data structures used for deployment, optimizing the structure and access to it for faster deployment. The summer of 2008, I interned at "Nvidia":http://www.nvidia.com/ in the embedded software group. I worked on drivers for their embedded platforms, along with application porting across different platforms. I also worked on setting up windows installation scripts to install drivers and setup communication between the windows box and the embedded platform. During 2009, I helped kick start a start-up company that worked on semantics based text generation to different languages. The purpose is to help create multi-lingual websites for a diverse customer base. I setup the development platform and initial demo using "ruby on rails":http://rubyonrails.org/. Currently I paused my commitment for the start-up to focus on my Ph.D thesis. Web design has always been my side hobby. I've been the webmaster for several clubs and organizations, and have built numerous websites throughout the years using different web platforms/techonologies with different web development languages. Some of my work (the ones publicly available) can be found in my "github":http://github.com/iliu repository. 

h3. Background

Born in Ithaca, New York, I have traveled through U.S. and Taiwan numerous times. Starting off with preschool in Taipei, Taiwan, I attended 1st and 2nd grade in Dallas, Texas. Then, I finished elementary school back in Taipei, Taiwan at "Long An":http://web.laes.tp.edu.tw/index.phtml elementary school and continued my middle school education at "Jinhua":http://www.chwjh.tp.edu.tw/ junior high school. During the summer of 1999, I moved to Fremont, California to attend "Mission San Jose High School":http://www.fremont.k12.ca.us/msjhs/site/default.asp. After graduating from Mission San Jose high school, I was accept by the "University of California, Santa Barbara":http://www.ucsb.edu, and earned my B.S. degree in "Computer Engineering":http://www.ce.ucsb.edu/ department, in which i was the top of my class in my department. I was then accepted into "University of California, Berkeley":http://berkeley.edu 's Ph.D program for the "EECS":http://eecs.berkeley.edu department, which I'm currently studying. Because of the re-locations to/from Taiwan, I am fluent in both English and Mandarin Chinese, able to both read and write very well. 

h3. Family

My beloved family currently consists of myself, my lovely wife - Emily, our fiesty cat - Bigby (named after a character from the comic "Fables":http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/graphic_novels/?gn=1606), and our friendly dog - Layton (named after the character in the nds game "Professor Layton":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Layton). The picture below was taken when Layton was first brought into the house. Bigby was trying to get to know him. No animals were hurt during the picture taking process.

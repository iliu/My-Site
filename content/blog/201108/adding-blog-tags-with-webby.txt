I just found out that Webby is no long under active development =(. What a sad piece of news. However, with the current Webby version, it's still good enough for me to maintain my blog. Since it's relatively easy to extend, I decided to add tags to Webby.

I saved a link to "Aarom Qian":https://github.com/aq1018/aaron-blog blog post about adding tags to Webby a long time ago, but unfortunately the blog is no longer online. I dug around and was able to find his "github":https://github.com/aq1018/aaron-blog  repository and the raw textile/erb entry in there. You can see it here: "Adding Blog Tags using Webby":/docs/adding-blog-tags-using-webby.txt.

In general his directions were pretty clear and everything worked well. It explained how to setup the tags framework and how to use rake tasks to generate the tag pages. However, I did need to make some minor hacks to get it working. I'll try to add a tutorial blog entry if i have time. I'd also be more than happy to answer any questions if anyone is having trouble implementing tags. 

In the mean time, try to follow along his post. Enjoy!

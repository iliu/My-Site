Is there a scalable way to create websites with only static pages? I don't want to continuously be adding html pages, or editing html pages...

The answer is Yes! I've began experimenting with static web site generators (currently using "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/), and my new site will be the results of this experimentation. I hope for the following when I'm experimenting with _Webby_:
* Separation of content and layout
* To use newer markup languages (textile, markdown, haml ... )
* All static pages when website is deployed 
* Easy to add content (or else i never will...), preferably a blog like structure

It seems _Webby_ has it all. So it's time to dive in and see what I can do with it!

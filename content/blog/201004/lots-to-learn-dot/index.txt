_Webby_ turned out to be very addicting... It's certainly as powerful as I imagined, with lots of room to play with. However, I haven't used _ruby_ in a while, so it's time to remember the syntax of ruby. I also learned to use _partials_ in my layout, so i can further separate content and layout. This is progressing along fairly nicely...

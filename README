INTRODUCTION

This repository is used to store the source of my personal
website. The website is in experimental stage, and it's being created
using Webby (http://webby.rubyforge.org/) which automatically
generates static pages from dynamic content. With the source on a
repository and static, i can easily deploy the site on any webhost.


INSTALLATION

Download the "output" folder from the repository, which contains the
full static website.
